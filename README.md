**What is Express.js?**
Express.js, commonly referred to simply as Express,
is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for building web and mobile applications.
It simplifies the development process by providing a suite of powerful tools and utilities to handle common web application tasks,
such as routing, middleware management, and HTTP request handling.

**Simplifies Server-Side Development:**
Express.js abstracts much of the complexity involved in setting up a server with Node.js. It provides a straightforward way to manage routes and handle HTTP requests,
allowing developers to focus more on the core functionality of their applications rather than on boilerplate code.

**Middleware Support:**
One of the standout features of Express.js is its middleware capability. Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req),
the response object (res), and the next middleware function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle. 
This allows for a modular approach to handling requests and performing various operations like logging, authentication, and error handling.

**Routing:** 
Express.js offers a robust routing system that helps in defining URL routes for different actions in an application.
This is particularly useful for building RESTful APIs,
where different endpoints need to handle different HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.).

**Scalability:**
With Express.js, developers can easily build scalable applications. The framework's modular nature allows for the creation of smaller, 
more manageable pieces of code, which can be combined to create complex applications. 
This is particularly beneficial for large-scale applications that may require frequent updates and maintenance.

**Large Ecosystem:**
Express.js has a large ecosystem of plugins and extensions available through npm (Node Package Manager).
This ecosystem provides pre-built modules for various tasks,
such as database interaction, security, and validation, which can significantly speed up development.
